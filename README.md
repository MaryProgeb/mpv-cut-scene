Save a favourite moment of the video with just one keypress

[mpv](https://mpv.io/) is a free, open source, and cross-platform media player

One of the cool features of mpv is running custom scripts by pressing a key while a video is playing. The `get_moment` script runs a command that saves a piece of video a few seconds before and a few second after the keypress (C).

Useful for generating content for video compilations or just saving favourite parts of movies/TV shows/etc.
